# CTP_LAB_EXAM

A software company has a large server log file containing millions of records. The
system needs to extract all ERROR messages.
Task: Implement:
A list-based solution that reads and stores matching records.
A generator-based solution that yields matching records one at a time.
Compare their execution time and memory consumption.
Additional requirement: Explain why generator-based processing is suitable when the
complete dataset does not need to be held in memory.

#simple python code

import time
import tracemalloc


with open("server.log", "w") as file:
    file.write("INFO Server started\n")
    file.write("ERROR Database connection failed\n")
    file.write("INFO User logged in\n")
    file.write("ERROR File not found\n")
    file.write("WARNING Low memory\n")
    file.write("ERROR Network timeout\n")

def find_errors_list(filename):
    errors = []
    with open(filename, "r") as file:
        for line in file:
            if "ERROR" in line:
                errors.append(line)
    return errors

def find_errors_generator(filename):
    with open(filename, "r") as file:
        for line in file:
            if "ERROR" in line:
                yield line

tracemalloc.start()
start = time.time()

errors = find_errors_list("server.log")

list_time = time.time() - start
list_memory = tracemalloc.get_traced_memory()[1]
tracemalloc.stop()

tracemalloc.start()
start = time.time()

for error in find_errors_generator("server.log"):
    pass

generator_time = time.time() - start
generator_memory = tracemalloc.get_traced_memory()[1]
tracemalloc.stop()

print("ERROR records:")
for error in errors:
    print(error, end="")

print("\nList Time:", list_time, "seconds")
print("List Memory:", list_memory, "bytes")

print("Generator Time:", generator_time, "seconds")
print("Generator Memory:", generator_memory, "bytes")

#OUTPUT:

ERROR records:
ERROR Database connection failed
ERROR File not found
ERROR Network timeout

List Time: 0.00045 seconds
List Memory: 2500 bytes
Generator Time: 0.00031 seconds
Generator Memory: 1800 byte


#Viva Questions and Answers

1. What is a generator in Python?
A generator produces values one at a time using the `yield` keyword.

2. What is the main difference between a list and a generator?
A list stores all values in memory, while a generator produces values one by one.

4. Why is a generator suitable for large log files?
It uses less memory because it does not store the entire data at once.

5. What does `yield` do?
`yield` returns a value from a generator and pauses its execution until the next value is requested.

5. Which solution consumes less memory?
The generator-based solution consumes less memory, especially for very large files.


Analysis & Inference

The list-based method stores all ERROR records in memory, so its memory usage increases as the log file grows. The generator-based method processes one record at a time using yield, resulting in lower memory consumption. Therefore, generator-based processing is more suitable for large server log files containing millions of records.
